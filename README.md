**Project Description**
While at Microsoft Research, Conal Elliott wrote a paper describing Functional Images: images and effects created from the application of functions, and christened them Pan.  PanBrowser implements a number of Pan functions in F#, and integrates them into a C# user interface.

## GUI Features
Images and Transforms can only be written in the F# source code and compiled, but images and transforms can have parameters varied at runtime and can be composed:
* Selection of images and transforms (currently only one transform, but planned to be multiple)
* Sliders to set parameters to the functions
* Standard scale, rotate and translation sliders for pre- and post-transformed image
* Button to Save image
* Background rendering of successively higher resolution images up to four-times oversampled (antialiased)
* 3D Images and transforms - using a marching cubes algorithm to plot an outline or iso-surface
* Trackball to rotate 3D images
**Planned features**
* Gallery feature to display multiple images, transforms or combinations of settings
* Animation features to allow settings to be varied continuously - possible make this a screen-saver mode 
* Runtime editing and compilation of new images/transforms
* 


## Example Image Functions
For example, here's a Mandlebrot set in F#/Pan:

``` 
//an image is a function that takes a Point (x,y) and returns a bool or Color
let mandlebrot p =
	let rec checkMand z i =
		if i > 200 then black
		else if (distFromOrigin z) > 2.0 then
			intToColor i
		else 
			checkMand (addp (complex2 z) p) (i+1)  // recurse with z=z^2 + p
	in checkMand origin 0
```

And here's how you turn it inside-out:

```
let polarTransform xf = toPolar >> xf >> fromPolar

//a Transform is a function that takes an image function and returns a new image function
//so F# type is (Point -> 'a) -> Point -> 'a  
let radialInvert = 
    let invert (r, th) = ( 1.0/r, th ) in
    transformImage (polarTransform invert)
```
